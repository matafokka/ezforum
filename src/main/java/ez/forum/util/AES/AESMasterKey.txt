This is a master key (including this text). Remove this one and type a strong one, like this: H! Qy	m g ah  b!AEn x@$rVig,	#o!h  ^642gs,,	   	 	7disR #b,bd		XD



!!! READ THE WHOLE THING !!!




This file provides a master key used to encrypt users' emails and passwords.
Using just this key, one can decrypt email but can't decrypt password.
Unfortunately, we have no way of encrypting emails without this key, because ezforum needs to know them.

!!! WARNING: Without the master key you won't be able to use your whole database !!!

If you don't want to get the whole list of your users' emails leaked, hide this key from everyone, including your system administrator.
To do so, you can:
	1. Find a trustworthy system administrator that will NOT have access to the database.
	2. Set such permissions to this file that will guarantee that:
		a. ezforum will be able to read this file.
		b. Your system administrators will not be able to read this file.
	3. Hardcode the password. To do so:
		a. Download ezforum source code.
		b. Open file "/ezforum/src/main/java/ez/forum/util/AES.java" and follow instructions in it.
		c. Compile and deploy the project.
		d. Remove your master key from the source code.
		f. You may remove this file.

_______________________________
Pro tip 1: use tabs and spaces. I doubt, someone will be able to reproduce them even if they have a picture of the key (without shown whitespaces).
Pro tip 2: you can remove this text if you don't need it.
